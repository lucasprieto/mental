# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-13
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

Build a personal mind centralization system in six phases: foundation and tech stack, MCP server that connects to Claude Code/Cursor, capture engine for automatic theme extraction and explicit tagging, session lifecycle tracking (open → resolved), webapp for viewing and managing items, and finally search/filter/manual entry features.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Establish project structure, choose tech stack, design database schema for mental items
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Tech stack decisions and project setup
- [x] 01-02: Database schema design and setup

**Details:**
- pnpm monorepo with workspace packages
- TypeScript with strict mode, ES2022, NodeNext resolution
- @mental/shared package with MentalItem type
- @mental/db package with SQLite + Drizzle ORM
- mentalItems table with id, title, content, tags (JSON), theme, status, resolution, sessionId, timestamps

### Phase 2: MCP Server Core

**Goal**: Working MCP server that Claude Code and Cursor can discover and connect to
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Basic MCP server with health check
- [x] 02-02: Tool registration and connection testing

**Details:**
- @mental/mcp-server package
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.x with stdio transport
- ping tool for health checks
- All logging via console.error (never console.log)

### Phase 3: Capture Engine

**Goal**: MCP tools that capture thoughts — auto-extract themes from context, support explicit tags
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Capture tool with theme extraction
- [x] 03-02: List and query tools

**Details:**
- capture_thought tool with SQLite persistence
- Theme extraction via pattern matching with fallback
- list_thoughts with filtering (status, limit)
- get_thought for single item retrieval
- cuid2 for ID generation

### Phase 4: Session Lifecycle

**Goal**: Items have lifecycle (open → resolved), session-aware resolution with summaries
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Item lifecycle states and transitions
- [x] 04-02: Session-aware resolution with summaries

**Details:**
- resolve_thought tool marks items resolved with summary
- reopen_thought tool reopens items while preserving history
- start_session and end_session tools
- Session-linked captures via sessionId field

### Phase 5: Webapp Core

**Goal**: Web interface showing dashboard with open items, recently resolved, themes/tags at a glance
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Webapp setup and routing
- [x] 05-02: Dashboard view
- [x] 05-03: Item detail view

**Details:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS
- Port 3001 for dev server
- serverExternalPackages for better-sqlite3
- Database connection to same SQLite as MCP server
- Dashboard with stats cards, theme/tag clouds, item lists
- Item detail view with full content and metadata

### Phase 6: Webapp Features

**Goal**: Search and filter (keyword, tag, date, status), manual entry/editing directly in webapp
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Search and filter functionality
- [x] 06-02: Manual entry and editing

**Details:**
- FilterBar client component with URL-based state
- Status/tag/theme filtering with AND logic for tags
- CaptureModal for creating new items
- EditItemForm for inline editing
- API routes for POST /api/items and PUT /api/items/[id]

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- pnpm for package management (fast, good monorepo support)
- SQLite + Drizzle ORM for simple, local-first persistence
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.x (stable, not pre-alpha v2)
- console.error for all MCP logging (avoid stdio corruption)
- cuid2 for ID generation (URL-safe, shorter than UUID)
- Next.js 15 + React 19 (latest stable)
- URL params for filtering (shareable/bookmarkable)

**Issues Resolved:**
- None - clean execution

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
