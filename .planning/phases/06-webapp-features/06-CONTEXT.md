# Phase 6: Webapp Features - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Search and filter should be a quick filter bar at the top of the dashboard. Click a tag, status, or date range to narrow down items instantly. No separate search page, no complex query builder — just fast, simple filtering where you already are.

Manual entry should be a quick capture modal. Hit a button, type your thought, save — minimal friction. Same frictionless philosophy as the MCP capture, just happening in the webapp instead of the IDE.

Editing should be possible but not the primary flow. The webapp is mainly for viewing and quick capture, with the ability to correct/update items when needed.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Fast filtering** - Narrow down to what you need instantly
- **Manual capture** - Add thoughts directly in webapp without MCP
- **Editing existing** - Update/correct items after capture

All three are equally important for a complete webapp experience.

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Bulk operations (select multiple, bulk delete, bulk tag) - defer to later
- Advanced queries (complex boolean logic, regex search, saved searches) - keep it simple
- Rich text editing - plain text is fine for now

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Quick filter bar at top of existing dashboard view
- Modal for new entry (not a separate page)
- Keep the same frictionless feel as MCP capture

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is the final phase of v1. Goal is completing the webapp so it's a fully functional companion to the MCP server — you can view, filter, capture, and edit all in one place.
