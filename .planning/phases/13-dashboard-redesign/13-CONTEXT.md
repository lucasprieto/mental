# Phase 13: Dashboard Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-14
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The dashboard should feel like a clean admin interface with a sidebar for filtering. When you land on it, you see stats at a glance at the top, then your open items take center stage in the main content area.

The sidebar houses all filters (status, themes) so filtering feels natural and persistent. Active themes should be shown in a slim, compact way - not taking up vertical real estate.

Open items stay front and center in the card grid. Recently resolved items are there if you need them, but collapsed by default - you expand if you want to see past work.

The overall feel: Linear-style minimal and clean, with subtle hover states. Calm, focused, not overwhelming.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Sidebar filters UX** - The filter sidebar should feel natural, easy to use
- **Visual cleanliness** - Reduce clutter, make the dashboard feel calm and focused
- **Quick access to open items** - Open items front and center, minimal scrolling to see them

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Dark mode - No dark theme yet, light mode only
- Mobile optimization - Desktop-first, mobile comes in Phase 16
- New features - No new functionality, just layout/UX improvements

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Linear-style aesthetic: minimal, clean sidebar with subtle hover states
- Stats row stays at top (keep current design)
- Active themes shown in slim/compact format (reduce vertical space)
- Filters move to left sidebar
- Open items card grid stays as-is
- Recently resolved section is collapsible, collapsed by default

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is a layout/UX phase, not a features phase. The goal is to reorganize existing functionality into a cleaner, more admin-dashboard-like layout without adding new capabilities.
